    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Recommended Wrapper | Why |\n",
    "|----------|-------------------|-----|\n",
    "| Simple/fast environments | `DummyVectorEnv` or raw Gym | Minimal overhead |\n",
    "| Most parallel scenarios | `SubprocVectorEnv` | Good balance of speed and simplicity |\n",
    "| Large observations (images) | `ShmemVectorEnv` | Optimized memory usage |\n",
    "| Multi-machine clusters | `RayVectorEnv` | Distributed computing support |\n",
    "| Maximum performance | EnvPool | C++-based, 10x-100x speedup |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Profile First**: Measure whether environment or training is your bottleneck before optimizing\n",
    "2. **Start Simple**: Begin with `DummyVectorEnv` for debugging, then upgrade to parallel versions\n",
    "3. **Use EnvPool**: If your environment is supported, EnvPool offers the best performance\n",
    "4. **Async for Variable Times**: Use asynchronous mode only when environment step times vary significantly\n",
    "5. **Proper Seeding**: Always implement the `seed()` method correctly in custom environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "- ❌ Using `SubprocVectorEnv` for fast environments → Use `DummyVectorEnv` instead\n",
    "- ❌ Forgetting to deep-copy custom states → States will be aliased in the buffer\n",
    "- ❌ Not implementing `seed()` properly → Parallel environments produce identical results\n",
    "- ❌ Using async collectors for testing → Causes exceptions in trainers\n",
    "- ❌ Assuming linear speedup → Account for communication overhead and straggler effects"
