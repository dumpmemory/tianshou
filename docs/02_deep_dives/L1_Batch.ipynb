    "# Batch\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Batch` class serves as a fundamental data structure within Tianshou, designed to efficiently store and manipulate hierarchical named tensors. This tutorial provides comprehensive guidance on understanding the conceptual foundations and operational behavior of `Batch`, enabling users to fully leverage Tianshou's capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial is organized into three sections: first, we establish the concept of hierarchical named tensors; second, we introduce basic `Batch` operations; and third, we explore advanced topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hierarchical Named Tensors\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical named tensors refer to a collection of tensors whose identifiers form a structured hierarchy. Consider a set of four tensors `[t1, t2, t3, t4]` with corresponding names `[name1, name2, name3, name4]`, where `name1` and `name2` reside within namespace `name0`. In this configuration, the fully qualified name of tensor `t1` becomes `name0.name1`, demonstrating how hierarchy manifests through tensor naming conventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of hierarchical named tensors can be represented using a tree data structure. This representation includes a virtual root node representing the entire object, with internal nodes serving as keys (names) and leaf nodes containing values (scalars or tensors).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=center>\n",
    "<img src=\"../_static/images/batch_tree.png\" style=\"width:50%\" title=\"data flow\">\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessity for hierarchical named tensors arises from the inherent heterogeneity of reinforcement learning problems. While the RL abstraction is elegantly simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "state, reward, done = env.step(action)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `reward` and `done` components are typically scalar values. However, both `state` and `action` exhibit significant variation across different environments. For instance, a `state` may be represented as a simple vector, a tensor, or a combination of camera and sensory inputs. In the latter case, hierarchical named tensors provide a natural storage mechanism. This hierarchical structure extends beyond `state` and `action` to encompass all transition components (`state`, `action`, `reward`, `done`) within a unified hierarchical framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "While storing hierarchical named tensors is straightforward using nested dictionary structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'done': done,\n",
    "    'reward': reward,\n",
    "    'state': {\n",
    "        'camera': camera,\n",
    "        'sensory': sensory\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    'action': {\n",
    "        'direct': direct,\n",
    "        'point_3d': point_3d,\n",
    "        'force': force,\n",
    "    }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge lies in **manipulating** these structures efficientlyâ€”for example, when adding new transition tuples to a replay buffer while handling their heterogeneity. The `Batch` class addresses this challenge by providing streamlined methods to create, store, and manipulate hierarchical named tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Batch` can be conceptualized as a NumPy-enhanced Python dictionary. It shares similarities with PyTorch's `tensordict`, though with distinct type structure characteristics.\n",

    "## Basic Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This section covers fundamental `Batch` operations, including the contents of `Batch` objects, construction methods, and manipulation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content Specification\n",
    "\n",
    "The content of `Batch` objects is defined by the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `Batch` object may be empty (`Batch()`) or contain at least one key-value pair. Empty `Batch` objects can be utilized for key reservation (detailed in the Advanced Topics section).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Keys must be strings, serving as identifiers for their corresponding values.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Values may be scalars, tensors, or `Batch` objects. This recursive definition enables the construction of hierarchical batch structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tensors constitute the primary value type. Tensors are n-dimensional arrays of uniform data type. Two tensor types are supported: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) tensor type `torch.Tensor` and [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) tensor type `np.ndarray`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scalars represent valid values, comprising single boolean values, numbers, or objects. These include Python scalars (`False`, `1`, `2.3`, `None`, `'hello'`) and NumPy scalars (`np.bool_(True)`, `np.int32(1)`, `np.float64(2.3)`). Scalars must not be conflated with `Batch`/dict/tensor types.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** `Batch` objects cannot directly store `dict` objects due to internal implementation using dictionaries for data storage. During construction, `dict` objects are automatically converted to `Batch` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supported tensor data types include boolean and numeric types (any integer or floating-point precision supported by NumPy or PyTorch). NumPy's support for object arrays enables storage of non-numeric data types within `Batch`. For data that are neither boolean nor numeric (e.g., strings, sets), storage within `np.ndarray` with `np.object` data type is supported, allowing `Batch` to accommodate arbitrary Python objects."
